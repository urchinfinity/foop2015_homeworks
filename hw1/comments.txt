*make [player_num] a variable to guarantee game could be continued after a player drops all cards

*//create an array cantaining repeated userID [user1 ID, ..., user1 ID, user2 ID, ...]
*//implement Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle, each user would abtain corresponding cards in ascending order
*//drop paired cards, start with C2(2)
*  algorithm:
*    if (card[i]-2)/4 == (card[i+1]-2)/4
*      drop card[i] and card[i+1]
*  note:
*    skip dropped card
*    notice the last card
*//before&after drawing card, check if the current player has no card
*//get random number with corresponding card length to draw a card from another player
*//go through the array and insert, check the cards before/after to see if there exists paired cards
*//check if the current player(s) has no card, if yes, the current player(s) is out of the game
